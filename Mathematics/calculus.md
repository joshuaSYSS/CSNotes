## Calculus

Calculus is probably one of, if not the most important concept for college or above knowledge. You can see it everywhere, from machine learning, economics, to geography.<br>
Getting good in calculus might not help you a lot in computer science, but not getting good in calculus will only make your path in computer science harder.<br>

### MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus
- Prerequisite: Basic Algebra, Geometry
- Difficulty: 2 / 10
- Expected Time to Learn: Weeks to at most few months
- [18.01 Single Variable Calculus](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/18-01-single-variable-calculus-fall-2006/)

### MIT 18.02 Multi Variable Calculus
- Prerequisite: 18.01
- Difficulty: 5 / 10
- Expected Time to Learn: Months to at most 1 year
- [18.02 Multi Variable Calculus](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/18-02sc-multivariable-calculus-fall-2010/)

I would say that these 2 courses are pretty important, but if you just needed the fundamentals of calculus, I'd say 18.01 + 18.02 Chapter 1 is already sufficient.
