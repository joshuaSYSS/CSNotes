### MIT 6.042 Mathematics for Computer Science
- Prerequisite: Basic Algebra and Geometry
- Difficulty: 4 / 10
- Expected Time to Learn: Weeks to Months
- [6.042](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-042j-mathematics-for-computer-science-fall-2010/)

### UCB CS70 Discrete Math and Probability Theory
- Prerequisite: Basic Algebra and Geometry
- Difficulty: 3 / 10
- Expected Time to Learn: Weeks to Months
- [CS70](http://www.eecs70.org/)

Both 6.042 and CS70 are not bad, but 6.042 includes some extra informations that helps computer science, like invariants.<br>
Both courses cover proofs, set theory, probability etc. fundamentals discrete math topics.
