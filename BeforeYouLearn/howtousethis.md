# Before You Learn
## How to use this notes?

Here, I will talk about some notations and keywords located throughout this notes.
1. In each section, I will provide a description on what that topic is.
2. For each material, the title will be in the form of [Author][*Course Number][Course Title] where * means if there exists.
3. Prerequsites denote the material you should learn before taking this course. If you believe the prerequsites should be more / less for a specific course, please email me and let me know.
4. Difficulty denotes how hard is it to learn this course. In general, 1 / 10 denotes pre-college stuff while 10 / 10 denotes graduate and above stuff.
5. Expected Time to Learn denotes the expected duration for a student to learn this course. Note this varies a lot, so take it simply as an extra relative measure, but not an absolute measure.

I attempt to learn the courses beforehand, but there are some materials that are strongly recommended by others (such as csdiy.wiki) and I haven't learnt it.<br>
Hence, for materials in this case, it will be denoted with ðŸŽ¯.
