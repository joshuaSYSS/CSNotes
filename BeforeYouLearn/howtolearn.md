## Before you Learn / How to self learn?

### Preface
I would say there are plenty of materials online that not only teaches you how to learn stuff on your own, but how to do that efficiently.<br>
In addition, everyone has their preferred way to learn, which when they are exposed to that type of learning, they can learn more efficiently.<br>
To learn more, check [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhgwIhB58PA) out.<br>
Hence, I would only give ways that you could discover your learning patterns, and personally, how I learn.

### Importance of learning patterns
<p>
  First of all, what is a learning pattern?<br>
  In my own words, I would say when a learner is exposed to their ideal learning pattern, they would learn more efficiently.<br>
  However, when they are not learning according to their learning pattern, they learn relatively slow, and eventually lose attention.<br>
  I don't know is this true for everyone, and is there any scientific researches to backup (Too lazy to search), but at least I observed phenomenons that can backup this theory<br>
  For example, I don't learn well by simply listening to teachers, or reading notes, but rather through experimentals, pattern finding and actually doing the exercise. On the other hand, one of my previous classmate is able to learn a 3 pages passage when only given 15 minutes.<br>
  Hence, if you aren't performing well, or simply find school too hard, it may not be due to your IQ, but rather you are learning incorrectly.

### Discovering learning patterns
<p>
  How to discover one's learning patterns then?<br>
  I would say it requires time and trial-and-error.<br>
  One way to do it is to learn an infamiliar topic through various ways. You can first try to learn it through lecture videos, then try lecture notes, last try doing assignments.
   On https://learning-patterns.com/) are some examples.

### How I self learn
<p>
  In comparison to others, I have a rather unique way to learn. I memorize information through doing exercise, and through observing others' exercise.<br>
  Basically, when I first come into contact with a topic, I scan through the theory / formulas. Then I analyze the example exercises provided and link them to the formulas provided. Last, I attempt to replicate what the example exercise do.<br>
  This is effective for me, hence I can learn a topic pretty fast by just doing a bit of exercise. However, this also determined the limitation of my abilities, as I will be only able to replicate what others had done, but not any original way to do it.
