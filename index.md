# CS Notes

## Preface
I always believed in the importance of self learning over going to school-like learning. However, there are plenty people that doesn't know how or where to achieve this.<br>
Hence, I decided to make this notes for everyone to learn Computer Science (and a bit of Mathematics) by yourself.<br>
This project was also inspired by [CSDIY](https://csdiy.wiki/), which I learnt a lot from. Thanks!

## Some extra things
I would try to learn all materials before providing it on this platform to ensure its quality.<br>
Also, if you see some topics are missing, it's because I'm still learning..
