# CS Notes

## Preface
I always believed in the importance of self learning over going to school-like learning. However, there are plenty people that doesn't know how or where to achieve this.<br>
Hence, I decided to make this notes for everyone to learn Computer Science (and a bit of Mathematics) by yourself.<br>
This project was also inspired by [CSDIY](https://csdiy.wiki/), which I learnt a lot from. Thanks!
